<h1>Our Aim</h1>
To build an AI powered real-time sign language translator, to help the deaf and hearing community talk to each other easily.
<h1>Our Proposal</h1>
<h2>HCI Research - How can AI models help the DHH community</h2>
The first aim is to understand the challenges faced by the DHH community better. In order to do that, we will: <br>
<ul>
<li> Conduct a large formative study amongst the DHH community â€“ both using forms distributed widely and a smaller number of 1:1 interviews with Human Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers </li>
<li> Report on the most important contexts where AI models can meaningfully support the DHH community </li>
<li> Curate a large number of templates of typical multi-turn conversations in the identified contexts </li>
</ul>

<h2>ASSIST - A Dataset for Workplace Communication</h2>  
<img src="../images/dataset.gif" float="center" alt="video dataset example" />
Once the context and the typical conversations have been identified, we will focus on data collection, i.e., recording videos of signers signing the different turns in the conversations. We call this dataset <i>ASSIST</i> and target for it to be the largest dataset in any sign language in the world, positioning such favourably to train the most accurate AI models for sign language recognition.

<h2>Build AI models for live sign language recognition on Microsoft Teams </h2>

Video conferencing tools, such as Microsoft Teams, have become a primary source of communication for white-collar employees in the post-pandemic reality. To enable seamless real-time conversation between Deaf and able persons, we will build AI models which that can transcribe in real-time signed gestures. Such real-time transcription can significantly reduce barriers to communicate and enable a wider range of people with no exposure to sign language to effectively communicate with Deaf people.  

<h1>The social impact that we want to create</h1>
As mentioned, India is significantly behind in building capacity for formal education in ISL, in employers having the support systems to hire Deaf people, and in building datasets and AI models to provide the technological support to the DHH community. We aim to change this significantly with impact on the following three axes:

<ol>
<li> Create a network of value-aligned organisations to create data resources at scale in Indian Sign Languages. </li>
<li> Establish scientific leadership in the space of AI technology for sign languages improving on all reported benchmarks of accuracy. </li>
<li> Build a usable, effective, and continuously improving tool for sign language communication on a video calling application (like Microsoft Teams) for the context of workplace communication. </li>
</ol>

<i>All our work will always remain in the open-source encouraging further research and innovation to scale our impact. </i>
