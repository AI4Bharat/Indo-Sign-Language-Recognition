# The ASSIST Project

The ASSIST project aims to make the world more accessible by helping the Deaf and Hard of Hearing DHH) community in India. Our aim is to build an AI powered Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translator, to enable easier communication between the DHH and hearing communities in work places.

Our plan was decided based on feedback obtained from the deaf community, and we seek to involve them in all our decisions. Based on a survey we conducted amongst the DHH community, we learnt that:

1. Our survey shows that 75% of the DHH community have problems at the workplace. This is higher than any other situation, such as banks, while shopping, at restaurants, with family etc.
2. Communication is the biggest issue for them while working, as 78% of the DHH community prefers using sign language to communicate. This means that they cant communicate with hearing people (as hearing people are ISL inaccessible). Our survey tells the same story, with 50% saying they cant talk to hearing people, and the rest being able to communicate only with their interpeter

This problem of communication can be fixed by having an auto-interpreter

The survey shows that 70% of DHH community works from home now, expected to continue post pandemic. Work from home communication happens over video calls, which can be easily integrated with auto-interpreter tech. Whatsapp, Zoom and Microsoft Teams are the 3 most used video calling apps, and we shall start with Microsoft Teams.
