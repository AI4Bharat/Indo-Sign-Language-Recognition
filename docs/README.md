# Indian Sign Language (Background)

The Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community is 50 lakhs strong in India. This community relies on sign language for communication. Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a well-developed and complete language with its own grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and other linguistic attributes, which are quite different from say the American Sign Language (ASL).

<p> However, India has very few certified ISL teachers numbering only in the thousands. This severe shortage significantly reduces the access to education: Less than 1% of the DHH community goes through formal ISL training. This challenge is further amplified by a lack of awareness within the general populace about basic sign language. In total, the DHH community finds communication amongst them and with others a big challenge to overcome on a daily basis. </p>
<p>This lack of formal education has an immediate and adverse impact on employability. Within the DHH community, the employment rate (amongst those seeking jobs actively) is an abysmally low <b>24%</b>. Further, employers in India have not yet built the capacity to enable Deaf people to work and succeed in their organizations, further impacting employability. </p>
<p> In summary, the DHH community faces a significant challenge due to low access to formal education, limited opportunities for employment, and almost negligible awareness of these challenges amongst the populace and employers. </p>
